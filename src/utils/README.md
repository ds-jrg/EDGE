# Utils

## Overview

This `Utils` directory contains  important utitilty functions of the Edge Framework.

1. **Visualization of Heterographs**: Script for generating visual representations of heterographs, aiding in the analysis and comprehension of complex graph structures within the Edge Framework.
2. **Preprocessing of RDF Datasets**: Scripts for preprocessing RDF (Resource Description Framework) datasets before converting them into OWL (Web Ontology Language) Knowledge Graphs (KGs).
3. **Conversion of OWL KGs to PyTorch Geometric Datasets**: A script designed to transform OWL Knowledge Graphs into formats compatible with PyTorch Geometric.
4. **Creation of Learning Problems** : ascript to create learning problems for the logical approaches from the training testing datasets. Ensure the datasets are downloaded in the specified folders before running the function.

If you wish to add more datasets, create the functions to preprocess the KGs similar to the subgraph based approaches process them.
